# Novel-pdf Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template pymaldebaran/novel-pdf
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your book.

## Using

```bash
quarto render
```

The resulting pdf should appear as a pdf (PDF-X file) in the `_book` directory.

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](example.qmd).

## Inspiration

I took heavy inspiration from thos great post about [quarto extensions](https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/quarto-extensions-explainer/index.html).
