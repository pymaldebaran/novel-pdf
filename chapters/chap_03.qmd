You can use *italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***, superscript^2^, subscript~2~, ~~strikethrough~~, `verbatim inline code`, Angle brackets links <https://quarto.org>, Classic markdown links [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

{{< scenebreak line >}}

You can also have footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]. Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write,
since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to
type the note.]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

{{< scenebreak line >}}

And also some shortcodes:

For example the `lipsum` shortcode separated by `scenebreak` shortcodes of different types:

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

{{< scenebreak >}}

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

{{< scenebreak blank >}}

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

{{< scenebreak line >}}

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

{{< scenebreak stars >}}

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

Now we jump 5 lines with `vspace` shortcode

{{< vspace 5 >}}

Jumped!
