# Chapter 3: DIVs and SPANs
## Test of many combinations of formating classes
:::

:::{.bold}
Three paragraphs formated as bold.

{{< lipsum 2 >}}
:::

:::{.italic}
Three paragraphs formated as italic.

{{< lipsum 2 >}}
:::

:::{.strikethrough}
Three paragraphs formated as strikethrough.

{{< lipsum 2 >}}
:::

:::{.smallcaps}
Three paragraphs formated in small caps.

{{< lipsum 2 >}}
:::

:::{.bold .italic .strikethrough}
Three paragraphs formated with combinations of previous formating classes.

{{< lipsum 2 >}}
:::

And the same thing with spans [this is bold]{.bold}, [this is italic]{.italic}, [this is strikethrough]{.strikethrough}, [this is in small caps]{.smallcaps} and [this is all together]{.bold .italic .strikethrough .smallcaps}, that's it.
