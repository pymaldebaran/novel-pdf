# Chapter 3: Basic formating
## Where we are going to present all the basic feature
:::

You can use *italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***, superscript^2^,
subscript~2~, ~~strikethrough~~, `verbatim inline code`, Angle brackets links
<https://quarto.org>, Classic markdown links [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

{{< scenebreak line >}}

You can also have footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]. Here is an
inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an
identifier and move down to
type the note.]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

You can also use so basic math like $E = mc^2$ or even present them as
equations:

$$
f(a)={\frac {1}{2\pi i}}\oint _{\gamma }{\frac {f(z)}{z-a}}\,dz
\tag{1}
$$

And we have support for line blocks too :

| This is a line block
| With multiple lines of text that should respect both word wrap...
|
| ...And manual linebreaks
| Like this

But if you want them without indentation at each new paragraph, you need to put
it a div block with the `.noparindent` class. Just like that:

:::{.noparindent}
| This is another line block
| With multiple lines of text that should respect both word wrap...
|
| ...And manual linebreaks
| Like this.
|
| But this time we have no paragraph indent.
:::

There is no support for code blocks (they are very complex and not something you
expect to need in a fiction novel) but you can use line blocks with
`noparindent` and `.monospace` classes applied:

:::{.noparindent .monospace}
| This is yet another line block (that mimicks a code block)
| With multiple lines of text that should respect both word wrap...
|
| ...And manual linebreaks
| Like this.
|
| But this time we have no paragraph indent and this should be in monospace font.

And some more text after.

{{< scenebreak line >}}

And also some shortcodes:

For example the `lipsum` shortcode separated by `scenebreak` shortcodes of different types:

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

{{< scenebreak >}}

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

{{< scenebreak blank >}}

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

{{< scenebreak line >}}

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

{{< scenebreak stars >}}

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

Now we jump 5 lines with `emptylines` shortcode

{{< emptylines 5 >}}

Jumped!

You can use an epigraph with an `epigraph` div:

:::{.epigraph by="John Lennon" from="An interview"}
When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key
to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I
grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the
assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life.

You can even use an epigraph with multiple paragraphs:

:::{.epigraph by="John Lennon" from="An interview"}
When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key
to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I
grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the
assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life.

...or with line block:

:::{.epigraph by="Robert Frost" from="Nothing Gold Can Stay"}
| Nature's first green is gold,
| Her hardest hue to hold.
| Her early leaf's a flower;
| But only so an hour.
:::

It's also possible to ask for a new page with the `clearpage` shortcode:

{{< clearpage >}}

This should appear on a new page.

And you can even ask for for a new page  that force the next page to be recto with the `cleartorecto` shortcode:

{{< cleartorecto >}}

This should appear on a new recto page.

And you can also simply put an empty page using `emptypage` and `clearpage` shortcode:

{{< clearpage >}}
{{< emptypage >}}
{{< clearpage >}}

And here is the followup after an empty page.
