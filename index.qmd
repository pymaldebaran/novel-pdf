# Back matter

<!-- Once upon a time, when printing was not so electronically automated, it was
difficult to add material to the end of a previously-typeset section of front
matter. So, if there was a subsequent printing of the book, with new material
that ought to go in front matter, the problem was solved by placing the new
material in "back matter." Then, the original pagination did not have to be
altered.

That is a situation you are never likely to address. When most authors speak
about "back matter," what they mean is explanatory material that follows the end
of the story. That is, anything after the final Chapter, Epilogue, or
Conclusion. A good example can be found in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Return of the
King, which has quite a bit of material following the end of the story. That
material discusses the language and history of the Elves, and a variety of other
things. But its page numbering continues Arabic. It looks like critical
commentary, but it is part of Tolkien's original, fictional structure for the
book. Thus, it is main matter.

So, your book is unlikely to have true back matter. If you do, DO NOT change
page numbering, this is not advised for P.O.D. books, as it may confuse someone
performing quality inspection; true back matter is so rare.
