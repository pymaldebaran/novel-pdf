It was a dark and stormy night. Lord Withens rode his horse through the gloom, which was, as heretofore mentioned, dark. Most gloom is dark, eh wot?

Moving right along, his horse arrived at the back door of Lady Wishintale's quarters. Sadly, Lord Withens was not on it, having slipped off his saddle along the way. That was because the weather was stormy.

% Chapter Two:

\ChapterTitle{Chapter Two}
\end{ChapterStart}

The night was still dark and stormy. This should not be surprising, seeing as how only half an hour has elapsed since the first chapter. That information was necessary, in case you put the book down and haven't read any of it for the last two weeks.

Lord Withens, wet and bruised, finally arrived at his destination. The reason he was wet was because, as has been noted, the weather was stormy. It was dark, too.
